"""Model Explorer offers an intuitive and hierarchical visualization of model graphs.

It organizes model operations into nested layers, enabling users to dynamically
expand or collapse these layers. It also provides a range of features to
facilitate model exploration and debugging, including the ability to highlight
input and output operations, overlay metadata on nodes, display layers in
interactive pop-ups, perform searches, show identical layers, GPU-accelerated
graph rendering, among others. It currently supports TFLite, TF, TFJS, MLIR, and
PyTorch (Exported Program) model format, and provides an extension framework for
developers to easily add support for additional formats.
